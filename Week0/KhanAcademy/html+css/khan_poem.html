    <h1>MY DAD</h1>
    <p>If I could write a story,<br>
    It would be the greatest ever told.<br>
    I'd write about my daddy,<br>
    For he had a heart of gold.<br>
    My dad, he was no hero <br>
    Known around this world.<br>
    He was everything to me, <br>
    For I was his baby girl.<br>
    I'd write about the lessons.<br>
    He taught me right from wrong.<br>
    He instilled in me the values<br>
    That one day I'd be strong.<br>
    He taught me to face my fears,<br>
    Take each day as it comes,<br>
    For there are things that we can't change.<br>
    He would say what's done is done.<br>
    He would say hold your head up high,<br>
    Carry yourself with pride.<br>
    Thanks to him, I am somebody,<br>
    I will never run and hide.<br>
    If I could write a story,<br>
    It would be the greatest ever told.<br>
    I'd write about my daddy,<br>
    For he had a heart of gold.</p>
